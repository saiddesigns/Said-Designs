The goal is a natural, cinematic, and professional result, preserving the subject's identity and character. Adhere to the following professional studio standards:

--- PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: FACE QUALITY & NATURALISM ---
- **Face Priority is Always On:** The quality of the facial retouch is the highest priority. Ignore outfit or background corrections if they compromise facial realism.
- **Preserve Skin Texture:** This is non-negotiable. You must preserve natural skin texture, including pores and fine lines that define character. The final result must NOT look waxy, plastic, or overly smoothed. Your process should emulate frequency separation, correcting color and tone without destroying micro-texture.
- **Identity Preservation:** You must perfectly preserve the person's core facial features, structure, likeness, and identity.

--- STUDIO RETOUCHING PIPELINE ---
1.  **Cleanup (Blemishes & Distractions):**
    - ${options.removeBlemishes ? "Subtly remove temporary blemishes, pimples, redness, and minor scars. Gently reduce under-eye discoloration, but do not completely remove it to maintain realism." : ""}
    - Clean up distracting stray hairs/flyaways around the head without altering the hairstyle.
2.  **Tonal & Dimensional Enhancement (Dodge & Burn):**
    - Apply subtle, localized dodging and burning to enhance facial contours.
    - Gently lift midtones on the forehead, cheekbones, and the bridge of the nose to add dimension.
    - Delicately burn to add definition to the jawline and cheekbones. Avoid harsh, obvious contouring.
    - Control specular highlights to prevent hotspots, keeping them elegant and photographic.
3.  **Color & Tone Harmonization:**
    - Correct any white balance issues and neutralize unnatural color casts from the environment.
    - ${options.correctSkinTones ? "Even out skin tone variations for a healthy, unified complexion. Ensure skin tones look realistic and vibrant." : ""}
4.  **Detail & Clarity Enhancement:**
    - ${options.sharpen ? "Apply micro-contrast enhancement to eyes, eyebrows, and lips to make them pop subtly. Sharpen eyelashes and hair details without creating halos or artifacts." : ""}
5.  **Eyes & Teeth:**
    - Gently brighten the sclera (whites of the eyes) to remove slight redness.
    - Add a touch of clarity and light to the irises.
    - Subtly reduce yellowness in teeth if present. Do NOT over-whiten.
6.  **Background & Artistic Effects:**
    - **Background Blur (Bokeh):** Apply a background blur with an intensity of ${options.backgroundBlur}%. A value of 0 means no blur. Higher values create a stronger depth-of-field effect, drawing focus to the subject.
    - **HDR Effect:** Apply a subtle HDR effect with an intensity of ${options.hdrEffect}%. This should enhance detail in both shadows and highlights without looking unnatural.
    - **Vintage Fade:** Apply a vintage film color fade effect with an intensity of ${options.vintageFade}%. This should gently reduce contrast in the blacks and add a slight warm color cast.
    - ${options.glossySkin ? `**Glossy Skin:** Add a tasteful, high-fashion glossy sheen to skin highlights (e.g., cheekbones, bridge of the nose) with an intensity of ${options.glossinessIntensity}%. This should look like a professional makeup effect, not oily skin.` : ""}

--- ADVANCED USER CONTROLS ---
- **Smoothness Intensity:** ${options.smoothness}%. This controls the blending of skin tones. A higher value means smoother transitions, but be extremely careful not to lose pore texture.
- **Light Balance:** ${options.lightBalance}%. This adjusts the overall exposure and tonal balance. Harmonize the light to be cinematic and flattering.

--- FINAL OUTPUT ---
- The result must be a single, retouched image. Do not add text or watermarks.
- Uphold the highest standards of professional portrait retouching, avoiding all common artifacts like plastic skin, over-sharpening, crushed blacks, or clipped highlights.`;

Preserve natural skin texture and pores, apply subtle Dodge & Burn for sculpting, correct blemishes tastefully, protect skin tones during grading, and always balance lighting to match the selected environment.

Before compositing, you MUST apply a professional studio-grade retouch to the person's face.
- **Face Priority is Always On:** The quality of the facial retouch is paramount.
- **Naturalism:** Preserve skin texture (pores) and the subject's identity perfectly. Emulate frequency separation. The result must not look plastic.
- **Cleanup:** ${options.removeBlemishes ? "Remove temporary blemishes, reduce under-eye discoloration." : ""}
- **Dodge & Burn:** Apply subtle D&B for sculpting and dimension.
- **Detail:** ${options.sharpen ? "Enhance micro-contrast in eyes/brows/lips." : ""}
- **Color:** ${options.correctSkinTones ? "Correct skin tones for a unified, healthy look." : ""}

  - **Light Direction:** The key light direction for the subject MUST be from the **${options.lightDirection}**. If 'Auto', detect the main light source in the generated environment and match it perfectly.
  - **Intensity & Ratio:** The key/fill ratio should be approximately ${options.keyFillRatio / 100}. A lower value means higher contrast. Ensure the subject's lighting intensity matches the scene to avoid a 'pasted on' look.
  - **Color Temperature & Grading:** The subject's white balance and color grade must align with the environment. Use the **'${options.wbAndGrade}'** preset as your guide. If 'Auto', select the most appropriate grade. For example, use a warm grade for interiors, a cool grade for neon scenes, or a cinematic teal-orange look where appropriate. Protect skin tones from unnatural color casts.
  - **Shadows & Grounding:** Generate a soft, grounded contact shadow consistent with the primary light source. The shadow softness should be around ${options.shadowSoftness}%. Add subtle ambient occlusion to avoid halos.
  - **Depth & Atmosphere:** When relevant to the preset (e.g., haze in Neon Alley, bokeh in outdoor shots), add gentle atmospheric depth to seat the subject realistically into the scene.

  - **Background Blur (Bokeh):** The environment you generate should naturally have a depth of field, but you can enhance this with an additional blur intensity of ${options.backgroundBlur}%. This will further separate the subject.
